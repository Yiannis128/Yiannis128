# Learn Godot - For Absolute Beginners: 1

## Introduction

This tutorial is designed for people with little to no experience with 
programming who want to learn how to create games using the Godot game engine.

This article will cover:

1. How to setup Godot.
2. How to use the editor on a very basic level.
3. How to write a simple gameplay.

This article will not cover how to write a full/complex game, in order to do
that, you need to know the basics. The game will be 2D as that is the easiest
type of game for beginners to understand. At this level, the third dimension
adds an extra layer of complexity that is unnecessary.

**This tutorial was developed using Linux, this shouldn't be a problem most of
the time as Godot is mostly platform independent, if there's different ways
of doing the same thing depending on the OS currently running, then there will
be instructions for Windows and MacOS also included, but they may be inacurate.
If you find any mistakes then email me for a correction.**

## Setup & Absolute Basics

### Downloading Godot

Downloading Godot is very easy, it is a standalone executable so all that is
required is heading over to the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download)
website's downloads page and downloading it.

While you're there, notice that there's a 
[learn](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) tab that takes you to the
documentation of the engine written by the engine developers. You currently
might not be able to fully understand some or all of the things there, if you
do not, then this tutorial will help you do so.

_The tutorial is currently designed for Godot version 4.0 as that is the
latest version of Godot. Versions earlier than 4.0 are not compatible with
this tutorial as there have been a lot of changes since the 3.XX versions.
Versions succeeding 4.0 may still be compatible with this tutorial as 4.XX
likely won't break any compatibility._
