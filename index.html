                Hello! My name is Yiannis Charalambous and I, as of writing this, am a second-year undergraduate student studying 
                <a class="TextStyledLink" href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer Science</a> at
                <a class="TextStyledLink" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I consider myself hard working, and eager to solve any problem I face. I usually
                start trying to solve the problem early on as I found out that that is the best way to face challenges. 
                I always have a desire to learn whenever possible and I enjoy reading.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I was always interested in computers, as a kid I always was facinated by them. This facination has pushed me forward over the years
                to advance my education in the subject. Programming has been my passion for the last couple years and I have everconstantly expanding my
                arsenal of knowledge on the subject.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Aside from programming, I am just an average guy that likes to hang out with friends, watch movies, play games, and
                have fun.
