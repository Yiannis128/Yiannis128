                Hello! My name is Yiannis Charalambous and I, as of writing this, am a second year undergraduate student studying 
                <a class="TextStyledLink" href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer Science</a> at
                <a class="TextStyledLink" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</a>.

                One quality that everyone tells me I have is that every problem that I face in my life, I always face it with optimism. I usually
                start trying to solve the problem early on as I found out that that is the best way to face challenges. 
                I always have a desire to learn whenever possible and I enjoy reading.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I was always interested in computers, as a kid I always was facinated by them. This facination has pushed me forward over the years
                to advance my education in the subject. Programming has been my passion for the last couple years and I have everconstantly expanding my
                arsenal of knowledge on the subject.

                My facination with programming started as a kid, around 10, I was playing video games and that's when I was inspired, I wanted to
                create my own video game. TODO
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Aside from programming, I am just an average guy that likes to hang out with friends, watch movies, play games, and
                have fun.
