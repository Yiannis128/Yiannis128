title: Text Encryption Software
section: 2017
---

This project was written in Visual Basic for my IGCSE end of year project.

The program allows you to load a text file and an encryption key, and it will
then, encrypt/decrypt the file using the loaded key. This was my first useful
project, and as you can imagine, it was badly written. The whole program was
written in about 4 source files (excluding the automatically generated UI files
that Visual Studio generates for you). Basic programming principles have been
applied; however, it is not something complicated.
