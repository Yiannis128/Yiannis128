AI Augmented ESBMC processing. Passes the output from ESBMC to an AI model that
allows the user to use natural language to understand the output. As the output
from ESBMC can be quite technical in nature. The AI can also be asked other
questions, such as suggestions on how to fix the problem outputted by ESBMC, and
to offer further explanations.

This is an area of active research. A technical paper was released alongside version 0.1.0 of ESBMC-AI.
