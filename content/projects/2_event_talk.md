This web application was a combined effort between me and a group of 5 other
people.

We were given complete creative freedom by the University to develop any kind of
web app and submit it at the end of our first year as a team project.

After designing some concepts for the website, and mock art, we eventually
decided to create a social media website that would be used to inform people
about events that were happening near them. Event organizers could add events to
the website, with relevant information, and then the users could upvote or
downvote each event so it could gain popularity. Furthermore, users could also
comment on each post about what their opinions were for the event.

The project was extremely well polished in the end and my team and I managed to
surpass our previous expectations in terms of feature complexity and quality.

Throughout the whole experience, we never felt like we were losing control, and,
we finished the project before the deadline.
