Written in C++ using libsdl2 and glm. This was the project I had to do for my
computer graphics course in my 3rd year of university.

The graphics engine is designed very modularly. Features can be disabled and enabled
very easily. The following features are supporting:

- Highly customizable particle emitters. All particle emitters seen in the video,
  (the smoke, the flare, the explosion particles) are using the same particle class,
  but the property values are changed.
- Basic model loading support.
- Model renderer.
- Camera system.
- Runs on Linux.
