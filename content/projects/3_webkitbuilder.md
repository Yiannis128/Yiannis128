NOTE: A new version of this program has been released, called StaticBuilder. It
is recommended to use StaticBuilder as it is faster, newer, and cross-platform.
WebKitBuilder will remain up for viewing purposes.

This project's goal was to create a way for html developers to be able to import content into their files in an easy and painless way that did not affect the actual website in any way.

There are a lot of reasons one may want to do this, among them being, to reuse code in an easy and error-free way. Imagine having a simple html page, you create a navigation bar that is going to be used throughout the website; normally, you would have to copy-paste the navigation bar html and CSS code in each page. This easily becomes a nightmare when you are constantly tweaking page elements that are common throughout the website. With this script, all it takes is to run it and your commonly used code, is automatically placed throughout the website in a matter of seconds.

This website, is in fact, created using this script. So, it's proven to work!
