StaticBuilder is the successor of WebKitBuilder. It is created using Python3 and it is much
better designed. Customization is currently only available by openning the source file and
changing the variable names.

StaticBuilder is a python script that allows you to re-use HTML code throughout a website
without the need to copy-paste the re-usable parts. Think of it as a macro in C. You define
your re-usable HTML in a file and then import it to different parts of the website. when
the website is to be viewed, run StaticBuilder and all the re-usable HTML will be placed
throughout the website.

This tool encourages code re-use in static websites and increases development efficiency.
