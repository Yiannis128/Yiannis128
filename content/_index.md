# About

Hello! My name is Yiannis Charalambous and I, as of writing this, am an
undergraduate student studying Computer Science at The University of Manchester.

I consider myself hard working, and eager to solve any problem I face. I usually
start trying to solve the problem early on; as I found out that that is the best
way to face challenges. I always have a desire to learn whenever possible and I
enjoy reading.

I was always interested in computers, as a kid I always was fascinated by them.
This fascination has pushed me forward over the years to advance my education in
the subject. Programming has been my passion for the last couple years and I
have been constantly expanding my arsenal of knowledge on the subject.

Aside from programming and solving problems, I spend my time hanging out with
friends, watching movies, playing games, and having fun :)
