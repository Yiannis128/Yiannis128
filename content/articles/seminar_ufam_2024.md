I recently presented our [group's](https://ssvlab.github.io/esbmc/) latest research to the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM). The experiments were conducted from January 2024 and April 2024. The video can be watched below.

## Abstract

As society increasingly depends on artificial intelligence, the need for trust in neural networks becomes more critical. However, neural networks often exhibit vulnerabilities that can undermine this trust. In this seminar, I will present our research group's efforts to enhance the reliability of neural networks embedded in C code. We utilize Large Language Models in conjunction with Bounded Model Checking to identify and repair these vulnerabilities effectively.
