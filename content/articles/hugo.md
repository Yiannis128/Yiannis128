Up to this point, this website was using static builder and article compiler to
build the static contents of the website while avoiding reuse of HTML. While
they were simple scripts written in shell script, they were extremely limmiting.
As the website grows and more articles are added, along with thumnails and
summary, I have decided to move to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hugo is extremely customizable and gives you so much flexibility that it allows
you to do pretty much anything that you will ever need. However, there is a
disadvantage to using Hugo over static builder. Hugo might be simple, however, I
consider it overkill for overly small websites that are looking for a simple
drop-in solution to reusing HTML. Static builder is even simpler. this isn't
meant to downplay or discredit Hugo, you can definitely get started with using
it as the documentation for it is very complete and there are also many tutorial
series online teaching you how to use every aspect of it.

As for static builder and article builder, I will be moving their articles to
the archived section of this website, and also archiving their repositories on
GitHub. Their code and articles can still be accessed, however, they will no
longer be worked on/maintained.
