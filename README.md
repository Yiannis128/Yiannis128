# Yiannis128's Github Profile

Hi there, I'm Yiannis. Welcome to my Github profile. Here you'll find some of the open source contributions I have made.

I'm a software engineer with experience in building a wide arrange of applications, including, full-stack web apps, native system software,

to name a few. I'm also interested in graphics, machine learning, cybersecurity.

# Projects

I have a lot of projects that have not been made public yet, due to them still being very mature yet. Here are some public projects
I've worked on:

## [ESBMC-AI](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc-ai)

ESBMC-AI is an AI LLM powered augmentation layer that works on top of ESBMC. ESBMC is the Efficient SMT-based Bounded Model Checker.

## [Compile Flags](https://github.com/esbmc/compile-flags)

Aimed to automatically detect and provide compilation flags for a variety of languages. Preferably ones targetted by ESBMC.

## [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/Yiannis128/markdown_editor/tree/master)

An early in development markdown editor Flutter widget library. The aim of the project is to provide a premium editing experience in Flutter
applications.

## [GoDo](https://github.com/Yiannis128/godo)

A simple library that adds typing into Digital Ocean's serverless Go functions. This makes the API much more concrete and allows
for better type-safety and documentation.

## [Golang Logger](https://github.com/Yiannis128/golang-logger)

Extremely simple to use, drop-in Go Logging library with verbosity level support.

## [Godot Asteroids](https://github.com/Yiannis128/godot-asteroids)

An in-depth tutorial series made for Godot 4.0 (a long time before it released). For some time, it was one of the only Godot 4 focused
turorial series. Now it should probably be updated. The articles can be accessed on my
[website](https://yiannis-charalambous.com/articles/godot-asteroids.html). The repository consists of the project files.
