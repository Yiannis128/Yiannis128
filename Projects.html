              This page contains information about all the projects that I have worked on and showed publically.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Please note that not all projects have been made with the level of quality that I now strive for today,
              since some, have been created for educational purposed throughout my learning endeavors.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Those projects have usually, no source code provided, and, there is an explicit warning about their state.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The main reason that they have been included are for demonstration purposes.

            <p>
              This project's goal was to create a way for html developers to be able to import content into their files in an easy and painless way
              that did not affect the actual website in any way.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There are a lot of reasons one may want to do this, among them being, to reuse code in an easy and error-free way. Imagine having a simple
              html page, you create a navigation bar that is going to be used throughout the website; normally, you would have to copy-paste the navigation
              bar html and css code in each page. This easily becomes a nightmare when you are constantly tweaking page elements that are common throughout
              the website. With this script, all it takes is to run it and your commonly used code, is automatically placed throughout the website in a matter
              of seconds.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This website, is in fact, created using this script. So it's proven to work!
