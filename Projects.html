              This page contains information about all the publically showcased projects that I have worked on.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Please note that not all projects have been made with the level of quality that I now strive for today,
              since some, have been created for educational purposed throughout my learning endeavors.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Those projects have usually, no source code provided, and, there is an explicit warning about the state of their creation.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The main reason that they have been included are for demonstration purposes.

              This project's goal was to create a way for html developers to be able to import content into their files in an easy and painless way
              that did not affect the actual website in any way.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There are a lot of reasons one may want to do this, among them being, to reuse code in an easy and error-free way. Imagine having a simple
              html page, you create a navigation bar that is going to be used throughout the website; normally, you would have to copy-paste the navigation
              bar html and css code in each page. This easily becomes a nightmare when you are constantly tweaking page elements that are common throughout
              the website. With this script, all it takes is to run it and your commonly used code, is automatically placed throughout the website in a matter
              of seconds.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This website, is in fact, created using this script. So it's proven to work!

                    This web application was a combined effort between me and a group of 5 other people.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We were given complete creative freedom by the University to develop any kind of web app and 
                    submit it at the end of our first year as a team project.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After designing some concepts for the website, and mock art, we eventually decided to create a
                    social media website that would be used to inform people about events that were happening near them.
                    Event organizers could add events to the website, with relevant information, and then the users could
                    upvote or downvote each event so it could gain popularity. Furthermore, users could also comment on each
                    post about what their opinions were for the event.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The project was extremly well pollished in the end and my team and I managed to surpass our previous
                    expectations in terms of feature complexity and quality.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Throughout the whole experience, we never felt like we were losing control, and, we finished
                    the project before the deadline.

              This project was written in Visual Basic for my IGCSE end of year project.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The program allows you to load a text file and an encryption key, and it will then, encrypt/decrypt the file using
              the loaded key. This was my first actually useful project, and as you can imagine, it was badly written.

              The whole program was written in about 4 source files (excluding the automatically generated UI files that Visual Studio
              generates for you). Basic programming principles have been applied, however it is not something complicated.
