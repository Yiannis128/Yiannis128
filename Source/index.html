                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Yiannis Charalambous and I, as of writing this, am a third-year undergraduate
                    student studying
                    <a class="TextStyledLink" href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer Science</a> at
                    <a class="TextStyledLink" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</a>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I consider myself hard working, and eager to solve any problem I face. I usually
                    start trying to solve the problem early on; as I found out that that is the best way to face
                    challenges.
                    I always have a desire to learn whenever possible and I enjoy reading.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I was always interested in computers, as a kid I always was fascinated by them. This fascination has
                    pushed me forward over the years
                    to advance my education in the subject. Programming has been my passion for the last couple years
                    and I
                    have been constantly expanding my
                    arsenal of knowledge on the subject.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Aside from programming and solving problems, I spend my time hanging out with friends, watching
                    movies,
                    playing games, and
                    having fun.
