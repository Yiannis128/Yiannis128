                <p>
                    StaticBuilder is the successor of WebKitBuilder. It is created using Python3 and it is much
                    better designed. Customization is currently only available by openning the source file and 
                    changing the variable names.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    StaticBuilder is a python script that allows you to re-use HTML code throughout a website
                    without the need to copy-paste the re-usable parts. Think of it as a macro in C. You define
                    your re-usable HTML in a file and then import it to different parts of the website. when
                    the website is to be viewed, run StaticBuilder and all the re-usable HTML will be placed
                    throughout the website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This tool encourages code re-use in static websites and increases development efficiency.

                <p>
                    Written in C++ using libsdl2 and glm. This was the project I had to do for my
                    computer graphics course in my 3rd year of university.
                    <br><br>
                    The graphics engine is designed very modularly. Features can be disabled and enabled
                    very easily. The following features are supporting:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
                    <li>
                        Highly customizable particle emitters. All particle emitters seen in the video,
                        (the smoke, the flare, the explosion particles) are using the same particle class,
                        but the property values are changed.
                    </li>

                <h1>Shinobi Arcade Bonus Level Remake</h1>
                <p>
                    This was a remake of the ninja star throwing bonus levels of the Shinobi arcade where the Shinobi
                    would
                    throw ninja stars
                    at the on-coming ninjas. This project was built using the Godot game engine.

                <h1>WebKitBuilder</h1>
                <p>
                    NOTE: A new version of this program has been released, called StaticBuilder. It is recommended to
                    use StaticBuilder as it is faster, newer, and cross-platform. WebKitBuilder will remain up for
                    viewing purposes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project's goal was to create a way for html developers to be able to import content into their
                    files in an easy and painless way
                    that did not affect the actual website in any way.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are a lot of reasons one may want to do this, among them being, to reuse code in an easy and
                    error-free way. Imagine having a simple
                    html page, you create a navigation bar that is going to be used throughout the website; normally,
                    you
                    would have to copy-paste the navigation
                    bar html and CSS code in each page. This easily becomes a nightmare when you are constantly tweaking
                    page elements that are common throughout
                    the website. With this script, all it takes is to run it and your commonly used code, is
                    automatically
                    placed throughout the website in a matter
                    of seconds.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This website, is in fact, created using this script. So, it's proven to work!

                <p>
                    This web application was a combined effort between me and a group of 5 other people.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We were given complete creative freedom by the University to develop any kind of web app and
                    submit it at the end of our first year as a team project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After designing some concepts for the website, and mock art, we eventually decided to create a
                    social media website that would be used to inform people about events that were happening near
                    them.
                    Event organizers could add events to the website, with relevant information, and then the users
                    could
                    upvote or downvote each event so it could gain popularity. Furthermore, users could also comment
                    on each
                    post about what their opinions were for the event.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project was extremely well polished in the end and my team and I managed to surpass our
                    previous
                    expectations in terms of feature complexity and quality.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Throughout the whole experience, we never felt like we were losing control, and, we finished
                    the project before the deadline.

                <h1>Text Encryption Software</h1>
                <p>
                    This project was written in Visual Basic for my IGCSE end of year project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The program allows you to load a text file and an encryption key, and it will then, encrypt/decrypt
                    the
                    file using
                    the loaded key. This was my first useful project, and as you can imagine, it was badly written.

                    The whole program was written in about 4 source files (excluding the automatically generated UI
                    files
                    that Visual Studio
                    generates for you). Basic programming principles have been applied; however, it is not something
                    complicated.
